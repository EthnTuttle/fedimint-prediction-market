# BTC++ Workshop

This repo contains a template for building a Fedimint module outside the upstream Fedimint git repo. In the past, creating a module has required forking Fedimint. But now you can build one outside the upstream repo and get many of the convenient developer tools we've built into the main repo, but without having to deal with all that code!
